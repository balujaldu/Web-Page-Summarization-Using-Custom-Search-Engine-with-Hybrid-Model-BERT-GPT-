# Web-Page-Summarization-Using-Custom-Search-Engine-with-Hybrid-Model-BERT+GPT
This project focuses on intelligent web page summarization by combining Google Custom Search API with a Hybrid Deep Learning Model (BERT + GPT).


This project demonstrates a Web Page Summarization system built using a Custom Search Engine integrated with a Hybrid BERT + GPT model. Instead of relying on a single webpage, the system dynamically fetches content from multiple sites using the Google Custom Search API, performs web scraping and preprocessing, and then applies deep learning to generate accurate and meaningful summaries. BERT is used to extract context-rich representations, while GPT ensures that the final summary is coherent, human-like, and aligned with the user’s query.

What makes this work unique is its iterative information retrieval process—if relevant data is not available on one webpage, the system automatically moves to another source until it finds the most suitable information. This ensures comprehensive coverage, contextual accuracy, and reliability in the generated output. With applications in research, news aggregation, knowledge discovery, and intelligent assistants, this project highlights the ability to integrate information retrieval, natural language processing, and deep learning into a practical AI-driven solution.


If you want to access my custom search engine, simply open VS Code, then open the folder from the Google Drive link below and run it. This will allow you to use my custom search engine directly.

Please make sure not to change the file structure or order inside the folder.
This project is not only about the webpage summarizer but also about building the custom search engine itself.
